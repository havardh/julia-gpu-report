report-template-latex
====================

LaTeX template I made and then proceeded to use for reports and assignments at NTNU.

It's here for my own convenience and contains stuff I've found myself often using or commented out instead of removing so I wouldn't have to go googling for it if I should need it again.

Wait why am I explaining myself to myself? I should know this stuff.
