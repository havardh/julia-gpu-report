The PTX.jl library main design objective was to be a full system
integration. This leads to the posibility optimize and extend each
subcomponent of the system. Here includes a more robust compiler (see
Section \ref{sec:disc:comp}), implementing all of Julia primitve
types. In addition the alternative paths mentioned in Section
\ref{sec:meth} such as a full fledged Julia language implementation on
the GPU can be considered.

From a performance viewpoint the fact that PTX.jl only supports global
adressing is a key limitation. To be able to optimize kernels for
speed, extensive utilization of local memory is required. The OpenCL
runtime library includes a lot of function operating on
vectors. Adding vector types \footnote{_Vector types_ here referes to
  OpenCLs _float4_ and friends.} would enable utilizing these
functions.
