\chapter{Conclusion}
\begin{markdown}

This report describes a library for tranlating vector function in the
Julia programming language to code that can execute on a NVIDIA
GPU. The library is built using both Julia and the LLVM compiler
infrastructure, utilizing the NVPTX backend. The result section shows
that the resulting code is as performant as equivalent code written in
CUDA and OpenCL C. Comparisons with current Julia CPU implementations
of Matrix Multiplication also indicates that there is a posibility to
offload even isolated computations to the GPU.

The results indicate that the unboxing of arrays approach taken by
this library does not incure a loss of performance over lower level
language implementations.

The library enables using the existing GPU libraries written for Julia
without modification.
