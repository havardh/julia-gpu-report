\chapter{Conclusion}
\begin{markdown}

This report describes a library for tranlating vector functions in the
Julia programming language to code that can execute on a NVIDIA
GPU. The library is built using both Julia and the LLVM compiler
infrastructure, utilizing the NVPTX backend. The results in Section
\ref{sec:res} shows that the resulting code is as performant as
equivalent code written in CUDA and OpenCL C. Comparisons with current
Julia CPU implementations of Matrix Multiplication also indicates that
there is a posibility to offload even isolated and relative small
computations to the GPU.

The results indicate that the unboxing of arrays approach taken by the
PTX.jl library does not incure a loss of performance over lower level
language implementations.

The library enables using the existing GPU libraries written for Julia
without modification.
